For implementing this approval flow and notification system in Spring Boot with WebSockets, here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. Accomplishing the Scenario with Spring Boot and WebSocket

To set up a WebSocket-based notification system in Spring Boot, follow these general steps:

1. **Configure WebSocket**: Define WebSocket endpoints in your Spring Boot application. For example, create a `/ws/notifications` endpoint that users (roles like Maker, Checker, etc.) can subscribe to.

2. **Authorization and Session Management**: Each user in the approval line (Maker, Checker, etc.) should have unique session tracking. This will ensure only the intended recipient at each stage receives the notification. You can use Spring Security with WebSocket to manage sessions and authorizations for different roles.

3. **Broadcast Notifications**:
   - **Transaction Initiation**: After the Maker initiates a transaction, the backend should publish a message to notify the Checker.
   - **Subsequent Notifications**: Each role can have a listener subscribed to the WebSocket channel that receives their notifications. Upon approval by Checker, the server notifies the Authorizer, and so on.
   - **Final Notification**: When the Final Approver approves the transaction, the server sends a notification to all roles in the approval line, indicating the transaction's completion.

4. **Server-Side Code Example**:
   - Use `SimpMessagingTemplate` to send notifications to specific roles.
   ```java
   @Autowired
   private SimpMessagingTemplate messagingTemplate;

   public void notifyRole(String role, String message) {
       messagingTemplate.convertAndSendToUser(role, "/topic/notifications", message);
   }
   ```

5. **Client-Side Subscription**: Frontend clients (e.g., JavaScript on your web app) should subscribe to the WebSocket channels relevant to their role to receive real-time notifications.

### 2. Performance Impact of WebSocket Subscription

WebSocket is designed for real-time communication with minimal latency, but it does maintain an open connection for each user. If your system has many concurrent users, WebSocket connections could consume resources. To manage this:

- **Scaling**: You might need to use load balancing and clustering if traffic grows.
- **WebSocket Broker**: Spring Boot supports a built-in broker (`@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker`) or can be configured with an external broker (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) to handle high traffic more effectively.
- **Connection Lifecycle Management**: Keep track of active users and disconnect inactive ones to free up resources.

### 3. Managing Notifications for Each Company Separately

Yes, you can manage notifications per company by adding a unique company identifier in your message routing. You can achieve this by creating topic-based subscriptions like `/topic/company/{companyId}/notifications`.

For example:

```java
public void notifyCompanyRole(String companyId, String role, String message) {
    messagingTemplate.convertAndSend("/topic/company/" + companyId + "/" + role + "/notifications", message);
}
```

This setup allows each company to have its isolated notification stream, ensuring that users in one company’s approval line won’t receive notifications from another company’s transactions.
